# Experiments on Segment Anything

This repository is a copy of the [official code of Segment Anything Model](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything). We perform segmentation tasks on the [BTCV dataset](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3193805/wiki/217789), using both the officially pretrained SAM model and our fine-tuned model.

Code for our experiments is available at `experiment/` directory. The raw data can be downloaded from the [link](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3193805/wiki/217789), and should be extracted to the `dataset/RawData/` directory, following the instructions in `dataset/RawData/extract.txt`.
